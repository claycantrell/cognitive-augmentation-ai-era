# Research Scaffold

**A ready-made project folder for academic research, powered by Claude Code.**

You talk to an AI assistant in plain English. It finds papers, downloads them, organizes your sources, manages citations, writes with you, and produces a finished document. You focus on the ideas — Claude handles the tedium.

Everything here is **free** and runs on your computer. Your research stays yours.

---

## What Is This?

Think of it as a **pre-organized filing cabinet for a research project** — except it comes with a built-in research assistant (Claude Code) that can:

- **Find papers** — "Find me recent papers about cognitive enhancement"
- **Download them** — "Download that first one"
- **Summarize them** — "What does this paper argue?"
- **Verify them** — "Has this paper's findings been contradicted?"
- **Organize your sources** — "Add this to my library"
- **Take notes** — "Create a reading note for this paper"
- **Write with you** — "Draft an introduction based on my outline"
- **Cite properly** — "Cite Smith 2024 in that paragraph"
- **Produce finished documents** — "Build my paper as a PDF"

You don't need to memorize commands or learn software. You just talk to Claude.

## Getting Started

### What You'll Need

1. **A Mac or Linux computer** (Windows users can use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install))
2. **Claude Code** — Anthropic's command-line AI assistant. Install it:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```
   (You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed first. If you don't have it, download it from that link.)
3. **A GitHub account** (free) — sign up at [github.com](https://github.com) if you don't have one

### Setup (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Get your own copy of this project
gh repo fork claycantrell/research-scaffold --clone
cd research-scaffold

# 2. Install the research tools
./setup.sh

# 3. Start Claude Code
claude
```

That's it. You're now talking to your research assistant. Try saying:

> "I'm researching the effects of sleep deprivation on memory. Help me find papers."

Claude will search for papers, show you the results, and ask what you'd like to do next.

## How to Use It (Just Talk)

Once Claude Code is running inside this project, you can say things like:

### Finding & Collecting Sources
- "Find papers about climate change and migration patterns"
- "Search for studies on cognitive enhancement published after 2020"
- "Download that paper — the DOI is 10.1038/s41586-020-2649-2"
- "Download this arXiv paper: 2301.00001"
- "I have some PDFs in my Downloads folder. Move them into this project and add them to my library."

### Reading & Understanding
- "Summarize the paper I just downloaded"
- "What are the key findings in sources/smith-2024.pdf?"
- "Has this paper's conclusions been supported by later research?"
- "Create a reading note for this paper"

### Writing
- "Show me my outline"
- "Draft the introduction section based on my outline and the papers we've collected"
- "Add a citation to Walker 2017 in the second paragraph"
- "Rewrite this paragraph to be more concise"
- "What's my word count?"

### Publishing
- "Build my paper as a PDF"
- "Export it as a Word document too"
- "Change the citation style from APA to Chicago"

### Project Management
- "What sources are in my library?"
- "Search my notes for anything about REM sleep"
- "Commit my progress — I just finished the literature review section"
- "What sections from my outline still need to be written?"

## How the Folder Is Organized

| Folder | What goes in it | Analogy |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `manuscript/` | Your paper — the actual writing | Your typewriter |
| `sources/` | Downloaded PDFs of papers you've found | Your file drawer of photocopied articles |
| `library/` | Organized metadata for each source | Your card catalog |
| `notes/` | Your reading notes on individual papers | Your note cards |
| `bibliography/` | Your formatted reference list | Your bibliography cards |
| `figures/` | Charts, images, diagrams | Your illustration folder |
| `scratch/` | Brainstorming, rough ideas, discarded material | Your wastebasket (that you can dig through) |
| `output/` | The finished product — PDF, Word doc, etc. | Your printer tray |
| `templates/` | Pre-made forms for notes and drafts | Your blank index cards |
| `docs/` | Detailed instructions for each tool | Your reference manual |

---

## How Citations Work

You write your paper in plain text. When you want to cite a source, you (or Claude) put its reference key in brackets:

```
Studies have shown a link between sleep and memory [@walker2017].

This was confirmed by later work [@smith2023, p. 42].

Multiple researchers agree [see @walker2017; @smith2023; @jones2021].
```

When you build your paper, the system automatically:

1. Looks up each reference in your bibliography
2. Formats the citation in proper academic style (APA 7th edition by default)
3. Generates a complete "References" section at the end

**You never format a citation by hand.** Want a different style? Just tell Claude: "Switch my citations to Chicago style."

---

## The Research Workflow

A typical session looks like this:

```
 1. Plan         "Help me flesh out my outline on [topic]"
 2. Search       "Find papers about [subtopic]"
 3. Download     "Download the top 3 results"
 4. Catalog      "Add them to my library"
 5. Read         "Summarize that first paper"
 6. Verify       "Has this paper been contradicted by newer research?"
 7. Notes        "Create a reading note for it"
 8. Write        "Draft the literature review section"
 9. Cite         "Make sure all sources are properly cited"
10. Build        "Build my paper as a PDF"
11. Repeat       "Now let's work on the methodology section"
```

All of this happens in conversation. Claude knows the project structure, the tools, and your progress.

## API Keys (Optional but Recommended)

Some search tools work better with a free API key. After setup, you'll have a `.env` file. Tell Claude:

> "Help me set up my API keys"

| Key | What it's for | Cost | Where to get it |
|-----|--------------|------|-----------------|
| `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY` | Faster, unlimited paper searches | Free | [semanticscholar.org](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api#Partner-Form) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | AI-powered paper summaries | Pay-per-use | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Alternative AI summaries | Pay-per-use | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |

The Semantic Scholar key is the only one that matters, and it's free.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need to know how to code?**
No. You talk to Claude in plain English. It handles everything.

**Do I need to know what a "terminal" is?**
Barely. You open it once, type `claude`, and from then on you're having a conversation.

**What if I already have papers saved as PDFs?**
Tell Claude: "I have PDFs in my Downloads folder — add them to my project." It will move them into the right place and catalog them.

**Can I collaborate with co-authors?**
Yes. This is a GitHub repository, so multiple people can work on it. Each person forks the project and pushes their contributions.

**What if something breaks?**
Tell Claude: "Something seems broken, can you check my setup?" It will run diagnostics and fix what it can.

**Can I use this for a dissertation or book?**
Absolutely. The structure works for any length. You can split chapters into separate files in `manuscript/`.

**I prefer writing in Word or Google Docs. Can I still use the rest?**
Yes. Use Claude for finding, downloading, and organizing sources. When you're ready, say "Export my bibliography" and import the `.bib` file into your word processor's citation manager.

**How is this different from Zotero, Mendeley, or EndNote?**
Those are GUI applications you click through. This is an AI-powered command-line workflow where you describe what you want in natural language and it happens. Everything is stored as plain text files you own — no proprietary database, no vendor lock-in.

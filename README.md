# Research Scaffold

**A ready-made project folder for academic research, powered by Claude Code.**

You talk to an AI assistant in plain English. It finds papers, downloads them, organizes your sources, manages citations, writes with you, and produces a finished document. You focus on the ideas — Claude handles the tedium.

Everything here is **free** and runs on your computer. Your research stays yours.

---

## What Is This?

Think of it as a **pre-organized filing cabinet for a research project** — except it comes with a built-in research assistant (Claude Code) that can:

- **Find papers** — "Find me recent papers about cognitive enhancement"
- **Download them** — "Download that first one"
- **Summarize them** — "What does this paper argue?"
- **Verify them** — "Has this paper's findings been contradicted?"
- **Organize your sources** — "Add this to my library"
- **Take notes** — "Create a reading note for this paper"
- **Write with you** — "Draft an introduction based on my outline"
- **Cite properly** — "Cite Smith 2024 in that paragraph"
- **Produce finished documents** — "Build my paper as a PDF"

You don't need to memorize commands or learn software. You just talk to Claude.

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Claude Code

You need two things on your computer. Open your **Terminal** app (on Mac, search for "Terminal" in Spotlight):

1. **Install Node.js** — download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and run the installer. This is a one-time thing that Claude Code needs to run.

2. **Install Claude Code** — paste this into your terminal and press Enter:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

3. **Log in to Claude Code** — type this in your terminal and press Enter:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```
   The first time you run it, Claude will ask you to log in. You have two options:
   - **Anthropic account** (recommended) — sign up free at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com). You'll get some free usage to start with, then it's pay-as-you-go.
   - **Claude Pro/Max subscription** — if you already pay for Claude at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai), you can connect that account instead.

   Follow the on-screen prompts — it will open a browser window where you log in, then come back to the terminal. Once you see Claude responding, you're in. Type `/exit` to close it for now — we'll come back to it in Step 3.

That's it. Claude Code is your AI research assistant. Everything else, Claude can set up for you.

### Step 2: Get Your Copy of This Project

You'll need a **GitHub account** (free) — sign up at [github.com](https://github.com) if you don't have one.

Then paste these commands into your terminal:

```bash
# Install the GitHub CLI (if you don't have it)
# Mac:
brew install gh
# Linux:
sudo apt install gh

# Log in to GitHub
gh auth login

# Get your own copy of this project
gh repo fork claycantrell/research-scaffold --clone
cd research-scaffold
```

### Step 3: Start Claude

```bash
claude
```

That's it — you're talking to your research assistant now. Say:

> "I'm new here. Help me get set up."

Claude will:
- Install all the research tools for you (`./setup.sh`)
- Offer to set up **VS Code** if you want a visual workspace (recommended — you'll see your files and Claude side by side)
- Walk you through optional API keys for better search results
- Help you fill in your research outline

### Your Workspace (if you set up VS Code)

If Claude sets up VS Code for you, here's what you'll see:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  FILE TREE (left)    │  YOUR DOCUMENT (center)          │
│                      │                                   │
│  > manuscript/       │  # Introduction                   │
│  > sources/          │                                   │

│                      │  CLAUDE CODE (bottom panel)       │
│                      │                                   │
│                      │  You: Find me papers about sleep  │
│                      │       and memory consolidation    │
│                      │                                   │
│                      │  Claude: I found 10 papers...     │
│                      │                                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Left panel** — your project folders. Click any file to open it.
- **Center** — whatever document you're reading or writing.
- **Bottom panel** — Claude Code. This is where you talk to your research assistant.

You don't have to use VS Code. Claude works fine in any terminal window. But VS Code lets you see your files updating live as Claude works, which is nice.

### Saving Your Work

This project automatically tracks every change you make — think of it as an **infinite undo button**. Here's all you need to know:

- **Claude saves your work for you.** After you make progress (finish a section, add a batch of sources, etc.), Claude will offer to save a snapshot. Just say yes.
- **You can always go back.** If something goes wrong, tell Claude: *"Undo my last changes"* or *"Go back to how things were yesterday."* Nothing is ever permanently lost.
- **Your work is backed up online.** Claude can push your saved snapshots to GitHub, so even if your computer dies, your research is safe. Just say: *"Back up my work."*
- **You don't need to understand Git.** Claude handles all of that behind the scenes. If you're curious, "saving a snapshot" is called a "commit" and "backing up online" is called a "push" — but you never need to type those words.

---

## How to Use It (Just Talk)

Once Claude Code is running inside this project, you can say things like:

### Finding & Collecting Sources
- "Find papers about climate change and migration patterns"
- "Search for studies on cognitive enhancement published after 2020"
- "Download that paper — the DOI is 10.1038/s41586-020-2649-2"
- "Download this arXiv paper: 2301.00001"
- "I have some PDFs in my Downloads folder. Move them into this project and add them to my library."

### Reading & Understanding
- "Summarize the paper I just downloaded"
- "What are the key findings in sources/smith-2024.pdf?"
- "Has this paper's conclusions been supported by later research?"
- "Create a reading note for this paper"

### Writing & Editing
- "Show me my outline"
- "Draft the introduction section based on my outline and the papers we've collected"
- "Add a citation to Walker 2017 in the second paragraph"
- "Rewrite this paragraph to be more concise"
- "What's my word count?"
- "Check my writing for grammar and style issues"
- "How readable is my manuscript? What's the grade level?"
- "Create a flowchart showing my methodology"

### Revising & Publishing
- "Build my paper as a PDF"
- "Export it as a Word document too"
- "Change the citation style from APA to Chicago"
- "Show me what changed between my first and current draft"
- "Help me write a response to these peer reviewer comments"

### Project Management
- "What sources are in my library?"
- "Search my notes for anything about REM sleep"
- "Commit my progress — I just finished the literature review section"
- "What sections from my outline still need to be written?"

## How the Folder Is Organized

| Folder | What goes in it | Analogy |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `manuscript/` | Your paper — the actual writing | Your typewriter |
| `sources/` | Downloaded PDFs of papers you've found | Your file drawer of photocopied articles |
| `library/` | Organized metadata for each source | Your card catalog |
| `notes/` | Your reading notes on individual papers | Your note cards |
| `bibliography/` | Your formatted reference list | Your bibliography cards |
| `figures/` | Charts, images, diagrams | Your illustration folder |
| `scratch/` | Brainstorming, rough ideas, discarded material | Your wastebasket (that you can dig through) |
| `output/` | The finished product — PDF, Word doc, etc. | Your printer tray |
| `templates/` | Pre-made forms for notes and drafts | Your blank index cards |
| `docs/` | Detailed instructions for each tool | Your reference manual |

---

## How Citations Work

You write your paper in plain text. When you want to cite a source, you (or Claude) put its reference key in brackets:

```
Studies have shown a link between sleep and memory [@walker2017].

This was confirmed by later work [@smith2023, p. 42].

Multiple researchers agree [see @walker2017; @smith2023; @jones2021].
```

When you build your paper, the system automatically:

1. Looks up each reference in your bibliography
2. Formats the citation in proper academic style (APA 7th edition by default)
3. Generates a complete "References" section at the end

**You never format a citation by hand.** Want a different style? Just tell Claude: "Switch my citations to Chicago style."

---

## The Research Workflow

A typical session looks like this:

```
 1. Plan         "Help me flesh out my outline on [topic]"
 2. Search       "Find papers about [subtopic]"
 3. Download     "Download the top 3 results"
 4. Catalog      "Add them to my library"
 5. Read         "Summarize that first paper"
 6. Verify       "Has this paper been contradicted by newer research?"
 7. Notes        "Create a reading note for it"
 8. Write        "Draft the literature review section"
 9. Cite         "Make sure all sources are properly cited"
10. Build        "Build my paper as a PDF"
11. Repeat       "Now let's work on the methodology section"
```

All of this happens in conversation. Claude knows the project structure, the tools, and your progress.

---

## API Keys (Optional but Recommended)

Some search tools work better with a free API key. After setup, you'll have a `.env` file. Tell Claude:

> "Help me set up my API keys"

| Key | What it's for | Cost | Where to get it |
|-----|--------------|------|-----------------|
| `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY` | Faster, unlimited paper searches | Free | [semanticscholar.org](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api#Partner-Form) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | AI-powered paper summaries | Pay-per-use | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Alternative AI summaries | Pay-per-use | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |

The Semantic Scholar key is the only one that matters, and it's free.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need to know how to code?**
No. You talk to Claude in plain English. It handles everything.

**Do I need to know what a "terminal" is?**
Barely. You open it once, type `claude`, and from then on you're having a conversation.

**What if I already have papers saved as PDFs?**
Tell Claude: "I have PDFs in my Downloads folder — add them to my project." It will move them into the right place and catalog them.

**Can I collaborate with co-authors?**
Yes. This is a GitHub repository, so multiple people can work on it. Each person forks the project and pushes their contributions.

**What if something breaks?**
Tell Claude: "Something seems broken, can you check my setup?" It will run diagnostics and fix what it can.

**Can I use this for a dissertation or book?**
Absolutely. The structure works for any length. You can split chapters into separate files in `manuscript/`.

**I prefer writing in Word or Google Docs. Can I still use the rest?**
Yes. Use Claude for finding, downloading, and organizing sources. When you're ready, say "Export my bibliography" and import the `.bib` file into your word processor's citation manager.

**How is this different from Zotero, Mendeley, or EndNote?**
Those are GUI applications you click through. This is an AI-powered command-line workflow where you describe what you want in natural language and it happens. Everything is stored as plain text files you own — no proprietary database, no vendor lock-in.
